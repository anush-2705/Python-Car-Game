Python Car Game
This is a simple car game built using Python. The game is a fun and interactive project that demonstrates my understanding of fundamental programming concepts, including game logic, object-oriented programming, and user input handling.
The project was developed as a hands-on exercise to build a complete system from the ground up, with a focus on creating an engaging and functional user experience.
Features
Object-Oriented Design: The game uses a class-based structure to represent cars and game elements, making the code modular and easy to manage.
Scoring System: Tracks the player's score throughout the game.
Collision Detection: Implements a robust collision detection system to handle interactions between the player's car and other objects on the screen.
User Input: Responds to user input for controlling the car's movement.
